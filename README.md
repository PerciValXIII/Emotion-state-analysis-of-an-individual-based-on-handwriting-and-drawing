# Emotion-state-analysis-of-an-individual-based-on-handwriting-and-drawing

There exists multiple negative emotions such as depression, anxiety and stress, which are seen as distinct states but have largely overlapping clinical symptoms. In the present study we propose to detect stress through handwriting as it is a daily human activity. Our approach consists of using a dataset which was created by collecting individual’s handwriting through a computerized platform and we will be predicting their emotional state through a machine-learning approach. The database used in this paper is called ”EMOTHAW” (Emotion recognition from handwriting and drawing) which includes samples of participants whose emotional states are assessed by the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS) questionnaire.

The 2 machine learning models used in this project are 
* Random Forest Classifier
* MLP Classifier
